Week 9 of Codeclan culminated in our second project, this time using Java to demonstrate competency in object oriented programming. For this project i chose to create an app to manage the dinosaur population in Jurassic Park.
The brief i was given is as follows:
Jurassic Park
Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create an app to manage the dinosaur population and visitor tracking of Jurassic Park. (No expense spared)

MVP
The user must be able to:

Add/remove paddocks to the park
Add/remove dinosaurs to the paddocks
Feed the dinosaurs appropriate food depending on whether they are herbivore or carnivore
Transfer herbivore dinosaurs between paddocks
Transfer carnivore dinosaurs between paddocks

Project Extensions
Dinosaurs marked as herbivores can live in the same paddock but those marked as carnivores can only be placed with dinosaurs of the same type.
Dinosaurs can randomly rampage and break out of their paddocks.
Visitors can enter / exit the park if the dinosaurs are not rampaging.
View the number of visitors in the prison at a given time.
Anything else you can dream up!

PREREQUISITES
IntelliJ IDE

download app, run in IntelliJ
run all tests
(final test in ParkTest fails often due to use of random functions in method)
